    principle: "The Eisenhower Principle, also known as the Urgent/Important Matrix, helps you distinguish between tasks that are urgent (require immediate attention) and important (contribute to long-term goals). This allows you to focus on what truly matters and avoid being reactive.",
    tooltip: "Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. Focus first on tasks that are both urgent and important."
  },
  [ToolKey.SWOT_ANALYSIS]: {
    principle: "SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique used to identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to a project or business venture. It provides a framework for reviewing strategy, position and direction.",
    video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9i_2Yf2i7s", 
    tooltip: "Identify internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats to make informed decisions."
  },
  [ToolKey.PARETO_CHART]: {
    principle: "The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In task management, this means identifying the vital few tasks that yield the most results.",
    tooltip: "Find the 20% of causes/efforts that produce 80% of effects/results. Focus on high-impact activities."
  },
  [ToolKey.DECISION_MATRIX]: {
    principle: "A decision matrix is a list of values in rows and columns that allows an analyst to systematically identify, analyze, and rate the performance of relationships between sets of values and information. It's particularly useful for making complex decisions with multiple criteria.",
    guide: "1. List options (rows).\n2. Define criteria (columns).\n3. Assign weights to criteria (0-100%).\n4. Score each option against each criterion (e.g., 1-10).\n5. Calculate weighted scores and sum them up for each option.\nThe option with the highest total score is often the preferred choice.",
    tooltip: "Objectively compare multiple options against various weighted criteria to find the best choice."
  },
  [ToolKey.GANTT_CHART]: {
    principle: "A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It lists tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity, and dependencies can be visualized.",
    tooltip: "Visualize project timelines, dependencies, and progress. Helps in planning and tracking."
  },
  [ToolKey.SMART_GOALS]: {
    principle: "SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework helps in setting clear and attainable goals, rather than vague resolutions, by ensuring goals are well-defined and trackable.",
    examples: "Vague Goal: 'Improve fitness.'\nSMART Goal: 'Run a 5K race in under 30 minutes by June 1st. This will be achieved by following a beginner running plan, training 3 times per week, and tracking my run times. This is relevant to my desire for a healthier lifestyle.'",
    tooltip: "Define goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound for better focus and success."
  },
  [ToolKey.RACI_MATRIX]: {
    principle: "A RACI matrix describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. It clarifies roles (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) and responsibilities, thereby reducing confusion and improving project execution.",
    caseStudy: "In a software project, defining who is Responsible for coding a feature, Accountable for its successful deployment, Consulted for UX design input, and Informed of release status prevents overlap, ensures all stakeholders are appropriately involved, and minimizes miscommunication.",
    tooltip: "Clarify roles (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for tasks to ensure clear ownership and communication."
  },
  [ToolKey.MANDALA_CHART]: {
    principle: "The Mandala Chart, or Lotus Blossom Technique, is a Japanese planning tool. It uses a 3x3 grid where the central idea is surrounded by 8 related sub-themes. Each sub-theme can then become the center of its own 3x3 grid, allowing for deep exploration and organization of thoughts.",
    guide: "1. Place your main theme/goal in the central square of the main 3x3 grid.\n2. Brainstorm 8 related sub-goals or actions and place them in the surrounding squares.\n3. For deeper exploration, take any of the 8 sub-goals, place it in the center of a new 3x3 grid, and repeat step 2.\n4. This creates a cascading structure of interconnected ideas.",
    tooltip: "Visually organize and expand on a central theme using a 3x3 grid structure. Each part can become a new center."
